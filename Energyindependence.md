_ESSENTIALLY_ the idea is to ship people out everything they need to build their own Wind Turbines (and start making money by cutting bills) ... and then on _MONDAYS, 11am GMT_ we will be running livestream guided assembly sessions for £25. Also all the parts or tools see source and supply will be the _guarenteed_ cheapest / best value for money. And there'll be more reasons why to build generators using our kit and livestreams but that's later down the pipe. For now just trust that £25 investment goes a long way, and eventually even further...
