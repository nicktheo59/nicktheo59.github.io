You've stumbled onto Nick L. Theodorou's website (that's me). <!-- [Jump to my Portfolio Projects](#Portfolio) -->

## FAQ : Why am I here? 

It's a good question. Let me try to give a firm answer:


“Take off your hat,” said the King to the Hatter.
<br/>
“It isn’t mine”<br/>
“I keep them to sell; I’ve none of my own. I’m a Hatter.”<br/>


In recent years Job Titles and Identities (even the ones that end in "-er") have become somewhat harder to define, since we're operating in an information-centric society.

So for the next 10 minutes (or however long you choose to visit), my aim is to leave you with:

* 1.) a better sense of what I do, through examples - [Jump to Portfolio Projects](#Portfolio)
* 2.) perhaps a new idea / perspective (some Informational 'Suprise' that is hopefully worthwhile) 
<!-- * 3.) mild feelings of passive amusement; (One day i'll be able to create video clips just by typing story lines, but until then don't expect anything milk-snorting) -->
* 3.) the _urge_ to become a valued newsletter subscriber - and part of something bigger [Sign up here](#mailing)

<!-- ## What is this 'Nikipedia' thing anyway?

The foundation of communication involves making assumptions about what other people know. I assume you can read English, or have access to a browser-extension that can translate this page for you. My main point is that 'knowledge clouds' exist between us, and in order for us to make  significant scientific progress in the future we will need to communicate more efficiently. The only other options are increasing the lifespan in which to make progress, or increasing the 'information bandwidth' in which to achieve. This 'personal knowledge cloud' is the low-tech solution for my half of the communication problem. Although in essence I started it almost 30 years too late to become a 'real-time' reflection, Nikipedia is an ongoing repository of 'time-series data' that mirrors the path of intellectual things I choose to explore / exploit.

Hi, My Name is Nick or Νικόλαος in Greek.
I wanted an easily-accessible place to share my projects and knowledge so I created this open source project.
The idea is this: 
- (Almost) every day I will write/think aloud/plan in a way that feels natural for me.
- Sometimes those writings will be worth 'refactoring' into their own document/project.
- I will polish / present those projects into something more coherent and reader-worthy here, on the first page.
- Finally, I will link between documents (html web pages) that I have personally generated in a wiki-like way --

-- to a) to serve as a firm foundation for my descendents to also build on top of (should I be so lucky!), and
b) to test my own understanding as I develop personal 'reference documentation'.
Continued maintenance of this project is also my personal fight against early-onset Alzheimer's, and it is likely one day some big data summaries could be extracted from the text files.

It is not enough to read and study; you must create and solve. [Jump to what I'm Aiming to solve](#aims)

## Aims
<!-- Age 2 I pick out the right numbers for my grandma. We won the lottery and I got to grow up in the right environment and get the right education.
Like an obsessive-compulsive I spent my entire waking life orientated towards one ideal, in the same way Chris Hadfield chose to eat is vegetables from age 6 because he believed it would make him more likely to become an astronaut(!) -- for me that ideal was more of a 'feeling' and that feeling was to 'search' for the roots of what drives humanity forward - and then contribute to it.   -->

What I have decided to work on:

- The Future of Transportation and Income-generation 
- The Future of Renewable Energy and Income-generation 
- The Future of Food and Waste Management [Larvae Labs](./Labs.md)
- The Future of Immersive Education
- Intermittent / necessary entrepreneur-ing (aka paying the bills)

### Now -- Dec 2020

 Right now (in Derek Sivers fashion) I'm working towards a Wind Turbine and portable Solar demonstration with the view of organising what I learn into Instructed "Airbnb Experience" for others to more easily do the same in the new year. I am conducting a technical and supplier review of Air Source Heat Pump installations for the UK market. And I'm also reviewing some interesting PhD and job opportunities that have come up. 

 Recently I reached a Proof of Concept milestone for 'TUTU' which stands for Top Up Track Usage, but have decided to shelve the project for the time being until I can come up the next steps to creatively de-risk the venture. The Renewables aim is also more pressing as the Government's GHG scheme will expire in March.

<!-- consider any opportunities relating (even very loosely) to my Aims - the four themes that relate my 'jigsaw puzzle' to create one thriving TinkerBricks House per neighbourhood of 20,000 people.  -->

<!-- 
Directing teams to develop Customer Relationship Management software ([which I have done](https://youtu.be/d_M9h4Ndxts)), studying Physics to Masters' level, or gaining 2-3 years employment in an advanced technology development setting, are all necessary and relevant experiences that come with the journey of achieving my Aims. In short: don't be shy, hire me.

### Progress on Aims

As a visual person I like to plan ahead and keep track of progress in the form of Comic-like pictures. I call it "Visual Accountability".
It beats re-reading a long, complicated plan when I have already thought through the project milestones (although full write-ups are available for the investors and finance people).
They can serve as a visible cue to keep you focused, but also create reference cues to more easily communicate progress between teammates and stakeholders.

LAMP Stack - Data-Driven 140 Line Twitter Clone <br/>
[Check it out here](http://tweetdemo.tinkerbricks.co/)

Algorithmia - Trained AI that rotates Photos for 'Horizon-correction' written in Python <br/>
[Check it out here](https://youtu.be/Gtc-aU-nG5g)

IBM Watson / Twilio - Telephony App that you phone to tell it your Symptoms and it responds with medical Advice ("Dr Watson")

Twilio / Zapier / Sheets - Send an email by typing a phone number in the Subject. Receive a call that reads out the body text. ("Robo Caller" - purely to learn, not to spam!). <br/>
To expand on this idea I used Yet Another Mail Merge and Google Sheets to automate and generalise the Robo Caller's abilities

Dialog Flow (api.ai) - Rough prototype of a Facebook Messenger chatbot designed to serve as "your Personal Recruitment Consultant". Launched the idea on Product Hunt under the brand name Emissary [by Persona Ltd, my company at the time]. Pitched to Nathan Bowles CEO, Smart Recruitment

Twilio - Setup a Toll-free number that routes to an office landline for Smart Recruitment

Unity - Immersive VR world with Animations and Teleportation, compatible with a range of headsets and WebVR 

![](./gif/v2r.gif)

Sketch / Principle - High-fidelity Mockups for a mobile-first YouTube Captions Search application. I then edited a 'vlog' style video documenting the process. FYI - the final half of this video covers an unrelated project (called Auto-Shares) <br/> 
[Check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM6DIXmob8A&feature=youtu.be) - x1.5 playback speed advised

Progressive Web Apps - Deployment of the _beautiful_ sample Books search app, idea is to swap out the Google Books API for Youtube Video results using Audio Transcription Microservice + a TFIDF algorithm written in Python

Glide - Ported a collection of public domain audio files into a step-by-step language learning course (App-based), includes a chat feature to find fellow students to practise with, and a [dummy] directory of local 1-to-1 language tutors. Also works as a Chrome App. <br/>
[Check it out here](https://wthwy.glideapp.io/)

Ethereum / Solidity / Metamask - Deployed my own smart contract to the Test Network to prototype an idea by Warren Buffett using my own "Bit of Nick" Tokens 

Typeform / Zapier / Trello - Built my own JustEat-style menu and order tracking system for my Dad's restaurant [to save their commission fees]

Typeform Zapier Trello + Stripe + AdWords - Used a similar 'Stack' to the JustEat-clone and prototyped a new startup idea in 4 days to test business viability and Unit Economics. Started generating sales.

Xcode / Unity - Experimented with Apple's newly released AR Kit to create an iOS app that demonstrates Augmented Reality

### Team Efforts

Everything above was strictly engineered by me (solely), anything below is from a team project which I Product Managed / Project Managed:

Although it's just a glimpse, all in all these 2 projects took up 4-5 years of my life, but can honestly now say I now have 'first hand know-how' about of what a professional business person could expect - chaired a board, raised venture captial, encounters with famous entrepreneurs _and that jazz_.

My Parents and Grandparents were in the Food Retail trade (specifically takeaway Fish & Chips) so as a teen I was unboundedly curious to demystify the heights of word "Business". This speaks to the point I made about "Hatters" (i.e. "Fish Fryers") and the less tangibly obvious role of Knowledge Workers behind the scenes -- I needed the concreteness of all these first-hand experiences in order to better relate to what makes the modern world tick.

## Niki's Wiki
***
"If you know a topic well enough you could have written the Wikipedia article"
Nikipedia is a 'web' of articles that reflects the state of my knowledge about a topic.
YOURNAME-ipedia would do the same job and side-by-side we could see the topic conflicts, similarities, breadth, or depth.


Essentially this is something I started doing on [Dropbox Paper](http://bit.ly/39WwyEj), then I switched to thinking about it in terms of a shareable github repo (starting with a portion of this here website), at some point I thought that an audio / definition format could be interesting ([Listen here](https://anchor.fm/nikipedia-xyz)), however I see Immersive Learning as another emerging medium for me to investigate. Ultimately the focus is for better use of technology to train up the next generation of engineers to a world-class standard more efficiently.




For some topics I decided to record an [Unlisted Video](./wiki/unlisted_videos.md) 🏁
Other topics warrant a full write up (when it is worthwhile to do so), and certain topics like the inner workings of magnetism should be supplemented with fabled _Immersive Interactive Experiences_

Here is a list of concepts I have been exploring or recapping: 

* [Quantum Error Correction](./wiki/QuantumErrorCorrection.md) 🏁
* Fermi Surfaces 🏁
* Formal Logic 🏁
* Combinators 
* Industrial uses for Protein folding solutions
*

<!-- To start your own personal "Nikipedia-like" project:
<br/>
* 1) Click the very first button at the top of this page, 
* 2) fork this Repo on Github, rename it the same as your Github username (in the same way I did with mine), this will give you a hosted website
* 3) replace my content with yours, style it however you like (optional), then tell me it exists (I would love to check it out)
<br/>
Same instructions go for Collaborating on my wiki entries / Correcting anything I wrote, plus
<br/>
* 4) commit the changes you made to a separate git branch, then open a Pull request on Github 
<br/>
Here are a list of folders within this website repo that I am willing to accept Pull Requests about:
<br/>
* ./wiki
* ./auto-shares -->


<!-- * ./tinkerbricks (tbc)
* ./solarclub (tbc)
* ./Just-The-Script.com (tbc)
* ./Alternate-Realities-visitorbook (tbc)
* ./Reunification-project (tbc)
* ./BSFL (tbc) -->

<!-- 
<br/>
Before I accept a Pull Request (in the spirit of this entire project) I will need time to demonstate the claim that your changes are now _actually_ part of my own personal knowledge repetoire -- to ensure that this website doesn't simply become a pale pale version of actual Wikipedia.
<br/>
If _everything_ ends up staying in this one repo (apparently that is how GOOGLE genuinely manage their entire code base), then for some projects/folders Containerisation will be essential ^^
<br/>
Similarly, for any larger media items, these "files" (like audio etc.) will merely be http links that point to their actual location on a CDN.
