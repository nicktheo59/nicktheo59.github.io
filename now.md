What I'm up to right now (in Derek Sivers fashion)

### -- July 2021 onwards


OK for me the purpose of this Page is to discuss only the things that make sense for you to hear about... 


I could mention: 
- Off-grid renewable energy systems 
- Formative assessments to compliment the Huberman Labs Podcast 
(this effort will serve as a guerilla marketing campaign for my prospective customers) as **I'm working on a supplement health food product.**
- Hybrid of Hybrids IPO
- Blockchain voting proposal for Cyprus reunification

For the time being however nothing springs to mind that would make sense for me to
spill the beans about.

## Hire Me !

<br/>
I've worked with companies large and small as the "bridge" between software developer and management teams. <br/>
If you have a digital product vision in mind but are unsure about where to go next... <br/>
_(and don't want to run up a huge bill before you are even confident about the whole process)_ <br/>
...it should be worth contacting me for at an initial conversation and guidance.
<br/>
If the matter is more cyber security related I have a number of contact to refer to you. One of these folks has even generously offered to volunteer their time to assist small businesses. Yes it's an unfamiliar area for many business leaders but don't become another statistic. Act.
<br/>
A good place to reach me directly is Twitter. DMs are open :)
