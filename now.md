What I'm up to right now (in Derek Sivers fashion)

### -- April 2021

Found a place to apply for grants to run the DIY renewable energy workshops from. Building a Mail Forwarding and Receipts organising App. Organising a flat-pack house building project (just for the garden to test currently). Starting an online physics course for skillshare! Found a 'glitch in the matrix' that I'll hopefully get around to.

## Software contractor For Hire 

<br/>
I've worked with companies large and small usually as the "bridge" between software developer and management teams. If you have a product vision but are unsure about where to go next to make it happen (and not get fleeced) I'm certainly worth speaking to for at least an initial conversation. Also I have a number of contacts to refer you for anything cyber security related, and have generously decided to volunteer time to assist small businesses. <br/>
A good place to reach me directly is Twitter. DMs are open :)
