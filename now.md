What I'm up to right now (in Derek Sivers fashion)

### -- March 2021

Crunch time: I've got to either bankrupt my company or figure out a way to pay a £3000 fine (to do with a miscommunication in "late" filed paperwork). I actually like the challenge of getting out of tough positions because however you do it that momentum usually continues. I found a place to rent for £128 which will actually give me an address and space to apply for grants to run the DIY renewable energy workshops.

Along those lines I went back to another idea that I've wanted to pursue from wayback when - a website where you can buy or exchange 'kit' parts. And using the house-building know-how from last month I might as well start high-end and market a £15k flat-pack house! The other focus on the horizon alongside that (and also fits into this whole DIY energy/housing theme) is a mail-forwarding service for narrowboat/caravan dwellers called PocketPost - I reckon around 300 customers would yield the reasonable level of self-sufficience needed to move forward. 99.5% Sure that I have all the tech capabilities to pull it off then the day-to-day running (and a created job) would be delegated to any willing young family member.
