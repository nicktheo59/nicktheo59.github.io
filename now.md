What I'm up to right now (in Derek Sivers fashion)

### -- Feb 2020

I'm working towards demonstrations of homemade renewable energy generation and storage systems - Wind, Solar, Battery. The plan is to adapt what I make into a half-day workshop for anybody to efficiently build the same thing themselves and start to save bills.
For interest I've started working through a property valuations university course booklet and a house building instruction manual. -- Thinking ahead about whether to buy or build. 


Recently, generator parts for the Wind turbine have been sourced and 'alternator belts from a car' identified as the best way to drive it - am working steadily towards the rest of the construction. Also I modified an 1899 patent for a zinc-bromine based battery bank for use with either the solar panel or wind turbine. The modification I came up with is in principle mechanical but it may be simplier to perform the same function using electronic-control in practise. Need to invest in my own a lab-bench power supply.

Since last time (thanks to Andrew Huberman and a Canadian Neurologist - https://neurogal.com) I corrected my sleep pattern and my post-Covid19 gastrointestinal abnormalities. The answers were none other Butter and Lux! If you're suffering just get in touch if you need more info!
