What I'm up to right now (in Derek Sivers fashion)

### -- July 2021 onwards


The main things I'm working on:

- Off-grid renewable energy systems 
- Formative assessments to compliment the Huberman Labs Podcast 
(this effort will serve as a guerilla marketing campaign for my prospective customers) as **I'm working on a supplement health food product.**
- Hybrid of Hybrids IPO
- Blockchain voting proposal for Cyprus reunification

Some details I can't discuss publicly because of trade secrets and whatnot, but if you need more context ask away.

## Hire Me - Experienced Contractor

<br/>
I've worked with companies large and small as the "bridge" between software developer and management teams. <br/>
If you have a digital product vision in mind but are unsure about where to go next... <br/>
_(and don't want to run up a bill before you are even confident about the whole process)_ <br/>
...it is worth contacting me for at an initial conversation and guidance.
<br/>
If the matter is more cyber security related I have a number of contacts to recommend. One guy has even generously offered to volunteer his time to assist small businesses with patching any Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities.
<br/>
A good place to reach me is Twitter. DMs are open :)
