Madonna talked about not wanting to be PPPedestrian, well this 2017 iMAC always takes like a million years to do anything (even to save a basic text file), my 2011 Windows 7 Toshiba is literally rapid in a side by side comparison (include benchmark PICS).

##On my non-core activities

I have certain obsessions, aside from wanting to achieve the 5 things i have mapped to my fingers, namely: BSFL; AR Book; Auto-S; TBricks; Solar (in reverse order)

I will pay someone to market my inventions and simply measure their progress. 

...mapped to my fingers... I want to attain the ability to construct a Trundel Wheel generator that ultilises the motion of water spinning inside it; I would be interested to construct a shallow stream generator also; 

That is my main motivation for wanting to re-learn physics and mechanics - or at the very least it is a target to aim for and keep in mind. 
The other motivation is to develop a proof for one of the Millienium problems (or at least be able to contribute and comprehend ideas). I lean towards addressing the Yang-Mills mass gap problem and/or the Navier-Stokes proofs - because of my background study and because I believe I have an original idea for each of them.

Namely, 2D N-S goes infinite at a sharp point because you need to invoke a line surface that does not exist i.e. in 3D you have the line surface above and below the point but in 2D it is just a point as hence a solution is not valid. 

###Yang-Mills

For Yang-Mills I barely have a handle on the problem (it's to do with the form of a solution equation that makes the Strong force drop-off at nucleus length scales but can maintain the infinite range of the residual Electromagnetic force) 
<!-- // coming back to look over this in March 2021 it's pretty clear that the distinction could be setup by isolating a different solution in terms of leptons vs hadrons, since electrons don't clump yet protons do. For this distinction the Pauli Exclusion Principle must be invoked therefore the answer will cut deep into the root of spin and likely provide a deeper understanding for the natural classification of particles as bosons or fermions. Look at gamma and beta decay and even positron decay (Rb-37 93%) for possible clues  -->

My idea is to do with re-developing everything from a radial charge-centric world (instead of position-time-mass orientatied) and most importantly re-formulating QM and the schrodinger equation for a complex 4D geometry (2 of space and 2i of time) - when I was learning this stuff I got attached to the fact that the Wave equation bore resemblance to E=C^2 M but in this analogy Energy would have to be the 2nd differential of time (and it could be 2 complex time dimensions <!-- //possibly interacting to give -1 --> at that). Mass would have to be the 2nd differential of displacement over position (and somehow links in with the binding energy [per nucleon]). For a laugh, around that time, the following year, I derived an equation analogously by using Schrodinger's exact methods - but I flipped the dimensions he used and enforced 1 of space and 2 of time (real at that).

But now I know that Yang-Mills is formulated as a set of matrix equations (tensors) - but they 'mysteriously' can't be formulated in a 3D + 1 Time standard Mass gap equation - the reason is that when you multiply Matricies together they are obscuring the underlying / symmetric complex time elements. The thing is loop quantum gravity researchers are trying to do away with the notion of 'time' on small length scales.

There's something else which says energy is not conserved over Universe-age time scales = and it is too ugly to reformulate everything so that energy is once again 100% convserved. <!-- //Perhaps the explanation of 'missing energy' would support my Dirac-inspired shrinking idea, which also explain universe expansion -- especially of Hydrogen/interstellar space, but this is so radical of an idea that I need to learn how to rule it out immediately, otherwise I'll just get hung up on this mad possibility.  -->
The other thing is my original 'naive' schrodinger equation may be very applicible to photons / light since the question 'what is waving' remains an open one ever since the Michelson-Morely experiment put to bed the notion of needing a medium in which to propagate as a wave. Under my theory we now know that the propagation medium is 2D complex time - which might explain reflection (-1) and polarisation (90 degree phase shifts). Also it is clear that photons are themselves 1D propagators in space while <!-- * --> their presence can influence the Electromagnetic field and their path is guided by the curvature of space-time ( thus introducing relativistic contraints) - it is clear they do not influence the curvature of their own path (no mass) nor are they disrupted by charges that they encounter since they are chargeless. But simply they talk to electrons. At this moment I would go as far to say they are two sides of the same coin. It is claimed that an anti-electron looks exactly like a regular electron prograting backwards through time.
My claim is there are waves of possibilities interating with mass-ive and charge-full particles of determanism, and ironically it is the long range theory of Gravity that looks most smooth and wave-like, while the wave-crests of possiblity are emerging as events of erratic particle determanism.
<!-- * while electrons are similarly point-like and interact/intersect at/in the perpendicular spatial plane... the argument that photons are the 'ghost particles' of both electrons and positrons (which are time-inverted electrons) could explain both the constant speed limit, non-conservation in terms of observational implementation and provide that 'clue' as to the fundamental assymmetry between bosons and fermions. Find me the nuclei that are classified to be fermions, THAT's where I wish to first look.. it's all neutral atoms with an odd number of neutrons, like Rb-37. Now I ask is beta/positron decay only possible from odd-neutron atoms? And the answer will be in electroweak unification theory-->

The only 2 space dimensions we needbe concerned with are 'down' or scale (where repeating patterns may emerge to form chains of geometric marvels for gravity) and 'out' (and radially would make the most sense for that). There are finite constituents (which is where we ge the emergence of depth) and there 'point-like' disturbances that are in motion (space and complex time) - our measurments are crude and pin them down in this 2D space realm - because of the earlier depth construct we get Quanta. 

But at this point my unknown open question is whether it will be necessary to involve another riddle of re-formulating Electroweak unification in order to re-cast it in 2+2i D constraints to make the rest of the theory work?

I've made no mention of neutrinos yet - what are they. <!-- //The 'cousins' of electrons, their mass is predicted in the Higgs model? I don't think so. Yet in my theory Mass exemplified/manifested through the second space differential. They also have ghost-like properties and often oscillate between 3 flavours yet in the case of a non-solar ejected case apparently the electron-neutrino does not. In my framework this can be 2D complex time related and therefore energy related. Perhaps the Cabibbo angle can be 'clue' to talk about non-perpendical 2D complex time interactions which thus posits 'pockets' of breaches into the spatial dimensions to explain neutrino-mass, especially as it propagates away from a 1/d^2 decaying curved space-time geometry such as the sun..and here we have stumbled upon our first hope for designing an experiment to validate a single aspect of this complicated 'rejigging' theory:
I hypothesise that electron-neutrinos ejected near the Schiehallion could display measurable oscillation discrepencies, with the argument that the variation in uniformity or strength of the gravitational field near this moutain may be a distortion able to provide this observation... although i'm not sure if actually the oscillations are in fact provided by time-like variability in the sun's field, or if any of what i just said even make any sense..LOL     --> 

This could explain the decay probabilitiy of neutrons. 
I don't know if a possible proton decay would make sense at this point (in Standard model it is longer than the age of the universe.)

Another question is that do photons begat electrons or do electrons begat photons? As in - can we find primordial photons that never interacted with electrons because certain quantum states of electrons are not allowed (and hence they cannot 'catch' these photons?). Should these photons still be reflected? If so - can we find them and perhaps trace the hubble expansion line from them??

***
Another thing I just realised about why this idea could make sense is that the mapping of the time component in Four-vectors for special relativity is -1 (i.e. i * i).
What is the best way to express 3 spatial dimensions as 2, using radial / sphereical units? I seems like it could be more natural. There is however an open question about mapping volumes perfectly between spheres and cubes in higher dimensional spaces. <!-- //Could take inspiration from the 'chamfer' tool in graphics softwares -->
