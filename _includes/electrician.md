# Electrician notes

This is a summary on how to tether a outbuilding or cabin / summer house to the grid.

1. Source parts from electrical merchant 
We used Mordale, I'll scan the whole receipt and link it somewhere for handy future reference.
2. Install Trunking
The mains plug, conduit, and trunking is first mounted to the wall 
3. LED flourescent light fittings 
We suspended these to the centre beams we decided to leave exposed when fastening the ply wood ceiling panels (More on alternatives and how to do this differently later)
4. Exterior security lights
5. Fuse Box
6. Armoured cable 
Measured length needed was 42m in total. 
First attach to the fuse board, then under the decking panels, cleated to the wall along the side of the garage,
and finally drill the garage and pull through from the other side
7. RCD
Mounted
8. Final connection 
Ground, neutral, Live.
Junior Hack saw, then stripped off with pliers.
First tested to find out which was the live and which was the neutral.
