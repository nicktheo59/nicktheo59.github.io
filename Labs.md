# Larvae Labs - Coming Soon

There's currently unlisted draft video of the concept and I really did start a Larvae colony to recycle food waste, as well as design a basic app for the concept video. I was hoping to enter it for Gordon Ramsey Future Food Stars but that didn't go ahead. <br/>

In the meantime, here's a vid of me chatting Larvae and testing out OBS:

I've distilled the proposition of Larvae Labs (aka _Our Future Our Food_ ) into a 2 minute concept video that I used to apply for a TV show, alas it is still a bit rough and ready, but I may decide to update this page with the _Draft Cut_ of that video for some feedback on the presentation style. (There may be a place in this world for Advertising folks after all..!)
