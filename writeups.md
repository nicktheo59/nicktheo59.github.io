AlphaGo, AlphaFold, AlphaQuark

I'm going to suprise myself with what I decided to get to work on at 6am today. 
It's an idea I've had brewing in some form or another for a couple of years, but for the first time since passively examining the question it now looks 'tentatively possible'.

Would it be conceivable for a computer programme to solve one of the Millenium Prizes?

It turns out merely *corroborating* a given theorem is a specialist task for a purpose-built proof checker (such as Coq) and is far from being an entirely smooth endeavour.
But that tells me and you there are people out there working towards such a thing. 

Another computer programme, going by the name Eureqa, works by creating random equations from the data it is given. It managed to figure out the Equations of Motion for a Double Pendulum. It even managed to "Rediscover" a set of seven known equations describing how the amounts of chemical compounds and enzymes fluctuate rhythmically in yeast cells (in cells deprived of oxygen aka yeast undergoing glucose metabolism).
Earthlings, we got this. Clay Mathematical Institute, get your cheque book ready.

Now admittedly I haven't diven particularly deep into the 'formal logic' pool, I took a cursory glance at some of the main 'information theory' history and concepts, and I have a bare bones understanding of Combinators, Mathematica, Recursive Learning through Self-Play, and the recent efforts to investigate a Hypergraph computational version of Fundamental Physics, but... put them all together...


Obviously we have data from the Large Hadron Collider, and perhaps one day a Lepton collider in the Terra / Mega Mega Electron-volt energy range.

There are Mathematica notebooks filled with a universe of knowledge (perhaps people realise this is where the intelligible parts of Siri's answers are coming from). And as of December 2020 these notebooks will have the ability to encapsulate an entire and complete system of logical reasoning (Combinatory logic).

And we do have a computer programme capable of teaching itself chess, go, protein folding, in a matter of hours and becoming the most capable entity on the planet at it.

-> Perhaps the stage has been set AlphaX lose on some computational problems *inside of* Mathematica.
Specifically some tedious Combinator computations.

My intuition tells me this is how it could work:

Since the "self-play" learning model of AlphaX lends itself to any game-like scenario, there should be a similar structure put in place to *reward* i.e. -> by invoking the use of relevant (well-accepted) theorems.
That is to say a Notebook could begins with a set of starting assumptions, and some final conclusive statement that should be proven true or false. There might be many ways to reach there but scores are awarded for invoking the use of computation steps that are more and more fundamental. Perhaps reasoning about geometry could be enough to solve many things, we already know that is the case for explaining gravity - recently corroborated *unequivocally* by the Wolfram Fundamental Physics.

(So we now know that it is Quantum Mechanics that needs a tweak, something to do with vacuum states and a t^3 phase factor?)
