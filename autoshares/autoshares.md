# Auto-Shares

Is a Patent-Pending invention enabling car owners to _seamlessly_ share out either vehicles with peace of mind. Way back when I 
<a href="https://autoshares.jimdofree.com/" target="_blank"> made a website</a>
 where I detailed my thinking in this space (and a video of the prototype). 

<br/>
There turns out to be far more moving pieces required to make this actually work in the marketplace, so that's why it's 3rd or 4th on my list of focus areas ATM. 


<br/>

<!-- 

Even though there are sub-brands to better help distinct customer segment identify with the product variation for their market
I've decided to brand _everything_ with the Auto-Shares brush. Make things simpler for every one.

This means the following will eventually be absorbed and become product names:

Solar Club
360Caravan
Tinkerbricks VR
Addback Ads
BSFL
Auto-Shares Pensions
VendHawk
TillHawk

I do understand that these loose and esoteric referrals to semi-baked products may raise more questions than they answer... I agree with you. ^^ -->
