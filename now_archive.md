What I was up to (in obsessive retrospective fashion)

### -

### -- Feb 2020

I'm working towards demonstrations of homemade renewable energy generation and storage systems - Wind, Solar, Battery. The plan is to adapt what I make into a half-day workshop for anybody to efficiently build the same thing themselves and start to save bills.
For interest I've started working through a property valuations university course booklet and a house building instruction manual. -- Thinking ahead about whether to buy or build. 


Recently, generator parts for the Wind turbine have been sourced and 'alternator belts from a car' identified as the best way to drive it - am working steadily towards the rest of the construction. Also I modified an 1899 patent for a zinc-bromine based battery bank for use with either the solar panel or wind turbine. The modification I came up with is in principle mechanical but it may be simplier to perform the same function using electronic-control in practise. Need to invest in my own a lab-bench power supply.

Since last time (thanks to Andrew Huberman and a Canadian Neurologist [- https://neurogal.com](https://neurogal.com) ) I corrected my sleep pattern and my post-Covid19 gastrointestinal abnormalities. The answers were none other Butter and Lux! If you're suffering just get in touch if you need more info!


### -- Dec 2020

I'm working towards a Wind Turbine and portable Solar demonstration with the view of organising what I learn into Instructed "Airbnb Experience" for others to more easily do the same in the new year. I am conducting a technical and supplier review of Air Source Heat Pump installations for the UK market. And I'm also reviewing some interesting PhD and job opportunities that have come up. 

Recently I reached a Proof of Concept milestone for 'TUTU' which stands for Top Up Track Usage, but have decided to shelve the project for the time being until I can come up the next steps to creatively de-risk the venture. The Renewables aim is also more pressing as the Government's GHG scheme will expire in March.
