What I was up to (in obsessive retrospective fashion)

### -


### -- Dec 2020

I'm working towards a Wind Turbine and portable Solar demonstration with the view of organising what I learn into Instructed "Airbnb Experience" for others to more easily do the same in the new year. I am conducting a technical and supplier review of Air Source Heat Pump installations for the UK market. And I'm also reviewing some interesting PhD and job opportunities that have come up. 

Recently I reached a Proof of Concept milestone for 'TUTU' which stands for Top Up Track Usage, but have decided to shelve the project for the time being until I can come up the next steps to creatively de-risk the venture. The Renewables aim is also more pressing as the Government's GHG scheme will expire in March.
