What I was up to (in obsessive retrospective fashion)

### -



<br/>



### -- July 2021 onwards


The main things I'm working on:

- Off-grid renewable energy systems 
- Formative assessments to compliment the Huberman Labs Podcast 
(this effort will serve as a guerilla marketing campaign for my prospective customers) as **I'm working on a supplement health food product.**
- Hybrid of Hybrids IPO
- Blockchain voting proposal for Cyprus reunification

Some details I can't discuss publicly because of trade secrets and whatnot, but if you need more context ask away.

### - June 2021

I Built a House.<br/>
(And skipped a now page update session).

### -- May 2021

After _CoFounder Shopping_ on the YC SUS web app, I started working with a German scientist on startup ideas. So far we're researching and testing my suggestion of subscriptions supplements but catering to a specfic niche market.  <br/>
Still taking baby steps towards the DIY workshops / flat-pack house, SkillShare courses, and Mail Forwarding App. <br/>
For simplicity I've shelved the other things for now. <br/>
I did start consulting for a £10M fintech start-up in Wales, in fact I was around to see it from the very beginning 3 years ago, although they now have 65 employees! Hopefully I will get to visit them in-person during the coming weeks. <br/>
For my "leisure work" I'm looking at mesoscopic systems; somehow I've got the idea it could be possible to construct a nano-sized device that performs a quantum analog to gyroscopic precession (whilst reacting dynamically as part of numerous processes). 

<br/>


### -- April 2021

Found a place to apply for grants to run the DIY renewable energy workshops from. Building a Mail Forwarding and Receipts organising App. Organising a flat-pack house building project (just for the garden to test currently). Starting an online physics course for skillshare! Found a 'glitch in the matrix' that I'll hopefully get around to.

### -- March 2021

Crunch time: I've got to either bankrupt my company or figure out a way to pay a £3000 fine (to do with a miscommunication in "late" filed paperwork). I actually like the challenge of getting out of tough positions because however you do it that momentum usually continues. I found a place to rent for £128 which will actually give me an address and space to apply for grants to run the DIY renewable energy workshops.

Along those lines I went back to another idea that I've wanted to pursue from wayback when - a website where you can buy or exchange 'kit' parts. And using the house-building know-how from last month I might as well start high-end and market a £15k flat-pack house! The other focus on the horizon alongside that (and also fits into this whole DIY energy/housing theme) is a mail-forwarding service for narrowboat/caravan dwellers called PocketPost - I reckon around 300 customers would yield the reasonable level of self-sufficience needed to move forward. 99.5% Sure that I have all the tech capabilities to pull it off then the day-to-day running (and a created job) would be delegated to any willing young family member.

### -- Feb 2021

I'm working towards demonstrations of homemade renewable energy generation and storage systems - Wind, Solar, Battery. The plan is to adapt what I make into a half-day workshop for anybody to efficiently build the same thing themselves and start to save bills.
For interest I've started working through a property valuations university course booklet and a house building instruction manual. -- Thinking ahead about whether to buy or build. 


Recently, generator parts for the Wind turbine have been sourced and 'alternator belts from a car' identified as the best way to drive it - am working steadily towards the rest of the construction. Also I modified an 1899 patent for a zinc-bromine based battery bank for use with either the solar panel or wind turbine. The modification I came up with is in principle mechanical but it may be simplier to perform the same function using electronic-control in practise. Need to invest in my own a lab-bench power supply.

Since last time (thanks to Andrew Huberman and a Canadian Neurologist [- https://neurogal.com](https://neurogal.com) ) I corrected my sleep pattern and my post-Covid19 gastrointestinal abnormalities. The answers were none other Butter and Lux! If you're suffering just get in touch if you need more info!


### -- Dec 2020

I'm working towards a Wind Turbine and portable Solar demonstration with the view of organising what I learn into Instructed "Airbnb Experience" for others to more easily do the same in the new year. I am conducting a technical and supplier review of Air Source Heat Pump installations for the UK market. And I'm also reviewing some interesting PhD and job opportunities that have come up. 

Recently I reached a Proof of Concept milestone for 'TUTU' which stands for Top Up Track Usage, but have decided to shelve the project for the time being until I can come up the next steps to creatively de-risk the venture. The Renewables aim is also more pressing as the Government's GHG scheme will expire in March.
